On April 5, 2020, COVID-19 was added to the Nationally Notifiable Condition List and classified as \u201cimmediately notifiable, urgent (within 24 hours)\u201d by a Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) Interim Position Statement (Interim-20-ID-01). The statement also recommended that all states and territories enact laws to make COVID-19 reportable in their jurisdiction, and that jurisdictions conducting surveillance should submit case notifications to CDC. COVID-19 case surveillance data are collected and reported voluntarily to CDC\u2019s COVID-19 Response.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p>These deidentified data include demographic characteristics, exposure history, disease severity indicators and outcomes, clinical data, laboratory diagnostic test results, and comorbidities. All data elements can be found on the COVID-19 case report form located at <a href=\"www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/downloads\/pui-form.pdf\">www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/downloads\/pui-form.pdf<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p>The Case Surveillance Task Force and Surveillance Review and Response Group (SRRG) within CDC\u2019s COVID-19 Response provide stewardship for datasets that support the public health community\u2019s access to COVID-19 data while protecting patient privacy.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p>COVID-19 case reports have been routinely submitted using standardized case reporting forms. On April 5, 2020, CSTE released an Interim Position Statement with national surveillance case definitions for COVID-19 included. Current versions of these case definitions are available here: <a href=\"https:\/\/wwwn.cdc.gov\/nndss\/conditions\/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19\/\">https:\/\/wwwn.cdc.gov\/nndss\/conditions\/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19\/<\/a>. All cases reported on or after were requested to be reported by public health departments to CDC using the standardized case definitions for lab-confirmed or probable cases. On May 5, 2020, the standardized case reporting form was revised. Implementation of case reporting using this new form is ongoing among U.S. states and territories.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p>The COVID-19 case surveillance data are dynamic; case reports can be modified at any time by the reporting jurisdiction as new information becomes available (i.e., data are subject to change). Furthermore, reporting jurisdictions may report cases late. Version updates to the detailed and limited datasets will be available for request once a month.<br \/>\nThe datasets will include all cases with an initial report date of case to CDC at least 14 days prior to the creation of the previously updated datasets. This 14 day lag will allow case reporting to be stabilized and ensure that time-dependent outcome data, including death, are accurately captured.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p>CDC\u2019s Case Surveillance Task Force routinely performs data quality assurance procedures (i.e., ongoing corrections and logic checks to address data errors). To date, the following data cleaning steps have been implemented:<br \/>\n<br \/>Questions that have been left unanswered (blank) on the case report form are re-classified to a Missing value, if applicable to the question. For example, in the question \u201cWas the patient hospitalized?\u201d, where the possible answer choices include \u201cYes\u201d, \u201cNo\u201d, or \u201cUnknown\u201d, the missing value is re-coded to Missing if the respondent did not answer the question.<br \/>\n<br \/>Logic checks are performed for date data. If an illogical date has been provided, CDC reviews the data with the reporting jurisdiction. For example, if a symptom onset date that is in the future is reported to CDC, this value is set to null until the reporting jurisdiction updates this information appropriately.<br \/>\n<br \/>The initial report date of the case to CDC is intended to be completed by the reporting jurisdiction when data are submitted. If blank, this variable is completed using the date<\/p>\n","5":"<p>CDC reports aggregate counts of COVID-19 cases and death numbers daily online. Data on the COVID-19 website and CDC\u2019s COVID Data Tracker are based on these most recent numbers reported by states, territories, and other jurisdictions. This data set of \u201cUnited States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by State over Time\u201d combines this information. However, data are dependent on jurisdictions\u2019 timely and accurate reporting.<\/p>\n<p>Separately, CDC also regularly reports provisional death certificate data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) on data.cdc.gov. Details are described on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/nchs\/nvss\/covid-19.htm\">NCHS website<\/a>. Reporting the number of deaths by using death certificates ultimately provides more complete information but is a longer process; therefore, these numbers will be less than the death counts on the COVID-19 website.<\/p>\n<p>Accuracy of Data<br \/>\nCDC tracks COVID-19 illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths to track trends, detect outbreaks, and monitor whether public health measures are working. However, counting exact numbers of COVID-19 cases is not possible. COVID-19 can cause mild illness, symptoms might not appear immediately, there are delays in reporting and testing, not everyone who is infected gets tested or seeks medical care, and there are differences in how completely states and territories report their cases.<\/p>\n<p>COVID-19 is one of about <a href=\"https:\/\/wwwn.cdc.gov\/nndss\/\">120 diseases or conditions<\/a> health departments voluntarily report to CDC. State, local, and territorial public health departments verify and report cases to CDC. When there are differences between numbers of cases reported by CDC versus by health departments, data reported by health departments should be considered the most up to date. Health departments may update case data over time when they receive more complete and accurate information. The number of new cases reported each day fluctuates. There is generally less reporting on the weekends and holidays.<\/p>\n<p>CDC reports death data on three other sections of the website: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/cases-updates\/cases-in-us.html\">U.S. Cases<\/a> &amp; Deaths, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/covid-data-tracker\/index.html\">COVID Data Tracker<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/nchs\/nvss\/covid-19.htm\">NCHS Provisional Death Counts<\/a>. The U.S. Cases and Deaths webpages and COVID Data Tracker get their information from the same source (total case counts); however, NCHS Death Counts are based on death certificates that use information reported by physicians, medical examiners, or coroners in the cause-of-death section of each certificate. Data from each of these pages are considered provisional (not complete and pending verification) and are therefore subject to change. Counts from previous weeks are continually revised as more records are received and processed. Because not all jurisdictions report counts daily, counts may increase at different intervals.<\/p>\n<p>Confirmed &amp; Probable Counts<br \/>\nAs of April 14, 2020, CDC case counts and death counts include both confirmed and probable cases and deaths. This change was made to reflect an <a href=\"https:\/\/cdn.ymaws.com\/www.cste.org\/resource\/resmgr\/2020ps\/Interim-20-ID-01_COVID-19.pdf\">interim COVID-19 position statement<\/a> issued by the Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists on April 5, 2020.

However, cost is not the only reason someone might delay or not receive needed medical care.

This funding supports healthcare-related expenses or lost revenue attributable to COVID-19 and ensures uninsured Americans can get treatment for COVID-19. HHS is distributing this Provider Relief Fund money and these payments do not need to be repaid.<br \/>\nThe Department allocated $50 billion of the Provider Relief Fund for general distribution to Medicare facilities and providers impacted by COVID-19, based on eligible providers' net reimbursement. It allocated another $22 billion to providers in areas particularly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak, rural providers, and providers who serve low-income populations and uninsured Americans.  HHS will be allocating the remaining funds in the near future.<\/p>\n<p>As part of the Provider Relief Fund distribution, all providers have 45 days to attest that they meet certain criteria to keep the funding they received, including public disclosure.  As of May 15, 2020, there has been a total of $34 billion in attested payments.  The chart only includes those providers that have attested to the payments by that date.  We will continue to update this information and add the additional providers and payments once their attestation is complete.<\/p>\n<p>CMS Accelerated and Advance Payments Program<br \/>\nOn March 28, 2020, to increase cash flow to providers of services and suppliers impacted by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) expanded the Accelerated and Advance Payment Program to a broader group of Medicare Part A providers and Part B suppliers. Beginning on April 26, 2020, CMS stopped accepting new applications for the Advance Payment Program, and CMS began reevaluating all pending and new applications for Accelerated Payments in light of the availability of direct payments made through HHS\u2019s Provider Relief Fund.<\/p>\n<p>Since expanding the AAP program on March 28, 2020, CMS approved over 21,000 applications totaling $59.6 billion in payments to Part A providers, which includes hospitals, through May 18, 2020. For Part B suppliers\u2014including doctors, non-physician practitioners and durable medical equipment suppliers\u2014 during the same time period, CMS approved almost 24,000 applications advancing $40.4 billion in payments.

National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia as of the date specified that have been received and coded. It is important to note that it can take several weeks for death records to be submitted to National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), processed, coded, and tabulated. Therefore, the data shown on this page may be incomplete, and will likely not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period especially for the more recent time periods. Death counts for earlier weeks are continually revised and may increase or decrease as new and updated death certificate data are received from the states by NCHS. COVID-19 death counts shown here may differ from other published sources, as data currently are lagged by an average of 1-2 weeks.<\/p>\n<p>The provisional data presented on this page include the weekly provisional count of deaths in the United States due to COVID-19, deaths from all causes and percent of expected deaths (i.e., number of deaths received over number of deaths expected based on data from previous years), pneumonia deaths (excluding pneumonia deaths involving influenza), and pneumonia deaths involving COVID-19; (a) by week ending date, (b) by age at death, and (c) by specific jurisdictions. Future updates to this release may include additional detail such as demographic characteristics (e.g., sex), additional causes of death (e.g., acute respiratory distress syndrome or other comorbidities), or estimates based on models that account for reporting delays to generate more accurate predicted provisional counts.<\/p>\n<p>Pneumonia deaths are included to provide context for understanding the completeness of COVID-19 mortality data and related trends. Deaths due to COVID-19 may be misclassified as pneumonia deaths in the absence of positive test results, and pneumonia may appear on death certificates as a comorbid condition. Thus, increases in pneumonia deaths may be an indicator of excess COVID-19-related mortality. Additionally, estimates of completeness for pneumonia deaths may provide context for understanding the lag in reporting for COVID-19 deaths, as it is anticipated that these causes would have similar delays in reporting, processing, and coding. However, it is possible that reporting of COVID-19 mortality may be slower or faster than for other causes of death, and that the delay may change over time. Analyses to better understand and quantify reporting delays for COVID-19 deaths and related causes are underway. The list of causes provided in these tables may expand in future releases as more data are received, and other potentially comorbid conditions are determined.<\/p>\n<p>Technical notes<\/p>\n<p>Comparing data in this report to other sources<\/p>\n<p>Provisional death counts in this report will not match counts in other sources, such as media reports or numbers from county health departments. Death data, once received and processed by National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), are tabulated by the state or jurisdiction in which the death occurred. Death counts are not tabulated by the decedent\u2019s state of residence. COVID-19 deaths may also be classified or defined differently in various reporting and surveillance systems.  Death counts in this report include laboratory confirmed COVID-19 deaths and clinically confirmed COVID-19 deaths. This includes deaths where COVID-19 is listed as a \u201cpresumed\u201d or \u201cprobable\u201d cause.  Some local and state health departments only report laboratory-confirmed COVID deaths.  This may partly account for differences between NCHS reported death counts and death counts reported in other sources. Provisional counts reported here track approximately 1\u20132 weeks behind other published data sources on the number of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. (1,2,3).<\/p>\n<p>Nature and sources of
